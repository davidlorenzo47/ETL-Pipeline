# ETL Pipeline for Weather Applications

## Project Description

The focus of this research project is to develop an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for weather applications. The project aims to extract current weather data from the Open Weather Map API, transform this data, and load data, using Apache Airflow for orchestration and automation.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Implement a data extraction process using the weather API.
- **Data Transformation**: Utilize Python for necessary data transformations, including cleaning, formatting, and structuring the data to ensure usability.
- **Data Loading**: Use AWS services to load the transformed data.
- **Orchestration**: Integrate Apache Airflow to streamline and automate the ETL process.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS
- **ETL Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Data Source**: Open Weather Map API

### Completed Milestones

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: Established the required infrastructure on AWS.
2. **Remote Development Environment**: Connected VS Code environment to AWS via SSH.
3. **Data Extraction**: Implemented Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Apache Airflow to extract data from the weather API. Successfully tested connection and data extraction.
4. **Data Transformation**: Transofrming Extracted data using python.
5. **Data Loading**: Loading Data using AWS.
